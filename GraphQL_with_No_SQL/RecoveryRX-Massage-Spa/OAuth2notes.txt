The code you provided is for logging in with Google OAuth and checking if the necessary scopes have been granted. For integrating with Google My Business API, you will need to redirect the user to the Google OAuth 2.0 endpoint to authorize the required scopes.

Let's break down the steps:

Google OAuth 2.0 Endpoint:
To initiate the OAuth 2.0 flow, direct the user to Google's authorization endpoint:
bash
Copy code
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?
  client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&
  redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&
  response_type=code&
  scope=SCOPES&
  access_type=offline
Replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID with your Google client ID, YOUR_REDIRECT_URI with the URI where you want Google to redirect the user after they grant/deny permission, and SCOPES with the space-separated list of scopes you're requesting.

For Google My Business, the scopes might be something like:

ruby
Copy code
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile https://www.googleapis.com/auth/business.manage
The access_type=offline ensures you get a refresh token, which you can use to get new access tokens without the user's intervention.

Handling the Redirect:
Once the user grants or denies the permissions, Google will redirect them to your specified redirect_uri. If the user granted permissions, the redirection will include an authorization code in the query string, e.g., YOUR_REDIRECT_URI?code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE.

Exchange Authorization Code for Tokens:
Using the provided authorization code, make a POST request from your server (backend) to Google's token endpoint to exchange the code for an access token (and refresh token if access_type=offline was specified).

POST endpoint: https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token

With the parameters:

code: The authorization code from the previous step.
client_id: Your client ID.
client_secret: Your client secret.
redirect_uri: The same redirect URI you used before.
grant_type: Set this to authorization_code.
The response will contain the access_token, refresh_token (if requested), and some other details.

Use the Access Token:
Now you can use the access_token to make authenticated requests to the Google My Business API or any other Google API for which you have been granted access.

Storing and Refreshing Tokens:
Store the refresh_token securely. Whenever the access_token expires, you can use the refresh_token to get a new access_token without requiring the user to log in again.

For the actual implementation in React:

The <GoogleLogin> component you're using essentially does the redirecting to the OAuth 2.0 endpoint and handling the response for you. However, if you wish to have finer control over the flow or implement additional steps, you might have to do manual redirects using the method described above.
Always ensure that:

Your client secret is kept securely and never exposed on the client-side.
Use HTTPS for all your endpoints.
Regularly review the OAuth 2.0 best practices to ensure the security of your users' data.
