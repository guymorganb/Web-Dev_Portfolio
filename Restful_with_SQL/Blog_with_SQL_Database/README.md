  ## Features
  - Continued work is need on this application, right now it doesnt support deleting posts or updating them, only commenting is supported, additionally the UI/UX could be improved but this is a decent MVP to display my abilities to make a full stack SQL based application.

  ## How to Contribute
  - visit github and for the repo, email me with any questions!
